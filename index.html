			<h1>Story</h1>
			<p>People from Central America are fleeing poverty and gang related violence and traveling north to seek asylum in
				the United States. Some parents plan to leave their children in their countries taken care by relatives or friends
				to later be reunited once they have stabilized economically. However, family separation places a tremendous amount
				of stress on the physiological and emotional development from child to parent bond. As a result, once the child
				arrives to the United States they experience acculturation challenges such as loneliness, lack of motivation in
				school, and overall defining a new identity to adapt to this new place.</p>

			<h1>Video</h1>
			<p>Attachment Theory, argues that disruptions in ‘affectional bonds’ with parental figures (especially mothers) can
				have profound negative psychological and developmental implications later in life. The loss of this bond with
				parents triggers grief responses that affect behavior.</p>

			<p>Since the majority of immigrant parents come to work in low paying jobs. The children are left home alone. Not
				only does this add to loneliness, but there is no one at home to check on them once the come back from school. With
				this in mind, children are left unattended and they have the freedom to choose what they want to do with their time
				after school. They have the option to watch TV the entire afternoon and evening until their parents come, neglect
				homework, or even worse, be influenced by the wrong crowd. According to a study done by professor Tim Gindling
				Graduate Program director of Economics with a concentration of Economic Policy Analysis at the University of
				Maryland mentions that children who were separated from their parents and later reunited in the United States
				struggled more academically than students that were not separated when they immigrated to the United States with
				their parents. </p>
